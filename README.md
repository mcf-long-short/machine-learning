# Machine Learning

## Introduction

Data analysis of various financial datasets and applying numerous ML models with strong emphasis on feature engineering and model evaluation and selection:
- Regression (OLS, PLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- PCA
- Classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Clustering (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm, DBSCAN)
- Neural Networks (Forward Feed Neural Network)

## Running Jupyter Notebook
We recommend viewing and running notebook files with [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index),
so you won't have to manage any of the python requirements compared with running them locally.
