# Machine Learning

## Introduction

Data analysis of various financial datasets and applying numerous ML models with strong emphasis on feature engineering and model evaluation and selection:
- Regression (OLS, PLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- PCA
- Classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Clustering (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm, DBSCAN)
- Neural Networks (Forward Feed Neural Network)

This repository represents group project work for course in `Machine Learning` for advanced degree [Masters in Computational Finance, Union University](http://mcf.raf.edu.rs/).
